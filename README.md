# travel_tide_customer_segment

Customer segmentation analysis focusing on user behavior, leveraging SQL for data management and Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

## Overview
To address the growing need for personalized customer experiences, TravelTide's marketing team is exploring the development of a tailored rewards program. To aid in this initiative, we conducted a customer segmentation analysis, revealing valuable insights into distinct customer preferences and behaviors. This data-driven approach aims to lay the foundation for a more customized, customer-centric rewards program, highlighting TravelTide's commitment to delivering exceptional travel experiences.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the evolving needs of the travel industry and the increasing demand for personalized customer experiences. With customers seeking more tailored solutions, travel companies must leverage data-driven insights to better understand their audience and deliver services that align with their unique preferences and behaviors.

By conducting a customer segmentation analysis, this project aims to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, enabling the design of targeted marketing strategies, customized rewards programs, and optimized travel offerings. The ultimate goal is to enhance customer satisfaction, foster loyalty, and create a competitive edge in the dynamic online travel market.

## Project background 

While this project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behavior, segmentation is a very general approach to data analysis broadly applicable to just about every domain. Whenever we suspect a dataset has some natural but hidden structure, we can use segmentation to reveal it.

## What is Traveltide?

Founded in April 2021, as the world began emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, this e-booking startup has quickly established itself as a rising star in the online travel industry. Its steady growth is fueled by cutting-edge data aggregation and advanced search technology.

## Business Questions

Back to business. From a business perspective, customer segmentation divides a customer database into groups to provide a tailored customer experience - rather than one size fits all. The business value of creating such groups is the ability to implement specific business strategies, including:
* Customized promotions (e.g. special offers, discounts)
* Personalized communications (e.g. targeted marketing emails)
* Specific account policies (e.g. credit line)
